                  Secure group communication for CoAP
               draft-tiloca-core-multicast-oscoap-latest

Abstract

   This document describes how to enable secure communication in a group
   of devices that exchange (multicast) CoAP messages.

   The proposed approach relies on Object Security for CoAP (OSCOAP)
   [I-D.selander-ace-object-security], with reference to the "one
   request - one response" model.  Only minor extensions or changes to
   OSCOAP are required.

   Furthermore, the proposed approach provides source authentication of
   group messages, by means of digital signatures produced through
   asymmetric private keys and embedded in the secure messages.

1.  Introduction

   TODO: motivation

   Even in the presence of an intermediary proxy, the use of multicast
   OSCOAP makes it possible:

   1.  on the listener side, to understand which is the specific
       broadcaster originating a multicast request message, so
       decoupling message security and IP addressing;

   2.  on the broadcaster side, to understand which is the specific
       listener originating a unicast response message as a reply to a
       multicast request message, so decoupling message security and IP
       addressing;

   3.  possibly adopt DTLS to protect hop-by-hop communication between a
       broadcaster and a proxy (and vice versa), and between a proxy and
       a listener (and vice versa), together with the adoption of secure
       group communication based on OSCOAP.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   words may also appear in this document in lowercase, absent their
   normative meanings.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [RFC7252] and [RFC7641].

   Terminology for constrained environments, such as "constrained
   device", "constrained-node network", is defined in [RFC7228].

   TODO: OSCOAP terminology.

2.  Scope description

   An endpoint joins a group by explicitly interacting with a
   responsible Group Manager.  An endpoint member of a group can behave
   as a broadcaster and/or as a listener.  As a broadcaster, it can
   transmit multicast request messages to the group.  As a listener, it
   receives multicast request messages from a broadcaster, and possibly
   replies by transmitting unicast response messages.  Upon joining the
   group, endpoints are not required to know how many and what endpoints
   are active in the group.

   According to the multicast CoAP specification [RFC7252], any possible
   proxy entity is supposed to know about the broadcasters in the group
   and to not perform aggregation of response messages.  Also, every
   broadcaster expects and is able to handle multiple unicast response
   messages associated to a same multicast request message.

   An endpoint that is member of a group is identified by an endpoint
   ID, which is associated to the group and shared among all its
   members.  Endpoint IDs are necessary in order to identify a given
   endpoint with no commitment to any protocol-relevant identifiers as
   IP addresses.  The Group Manager generates and manages endpoint IDs
   in order to ensure their uniqueness within a same multicast group.
   That is, there cannot be multiple endpoints that belong to the same
   group and are associated to a same endpoint ID.

   An endpoint needs to have other data, in order to participate in the
   group communication, such for example the shared keying material to
   protect and verify the message and the public keys of the
   broadcasters of the groups, in order to verify digital signatures of
   secure messages and ensure their source authenticity.  These pieces
   of information are provided by the Group Manager through out-of-band

   means or other pre-established secure channels; further details about
   establishment, revocation and renewal of the group context and key
   material is out of the scope of this document.

3.  Security context

   To support multicast communication secured with OSCOAP, each endpoint
   maintains a security context as defined in section 3 of
   [I-D.selander-ace-object-security].  In particular, each endpoint in
   a group stores:

   1.  one Common Context, containing the Context Identifier and the
       Base Key used to derive the keying material (Section 3.2 of
       [I-D.selander-ace-object-security]);

   2.  one Sender Context, used to secure outgoing messages;

   3.  one Recipient Context for each different broadcaster from which
       messages are received, used to process such incoming secure
       messages.

   In addition to what is defined in [I-D.selander-ace-object-security],
   the Sender Context stores the endpoint's own asymmetric public-
   private key pair, and each Recipient Context stores the other
   broadcaster's public key.

4.  Message exchange

   The message exchanged is protected as a non-multicast message, with
   the following addition: the Sender ID of the endpoint must be sent
   explicitely.  The Sender ID MUST be sent in the COSE object, as
   defined in Section TBD of [I-D.selander-ace-object-security]).

5.  Binding between requests and responses

   The mapping between a unicast response message and the associated
   multicast request message relies on the same principle adopted in
   OSCOAP [I-D.selander-ace-object-security].  That is, it is based on
   the Transaction Identifier, included by listener endpoints in the
   COSE object conveyed in their own unicast response message to a
   multicast request message.

6.  Message processing

   The processing for securing multicast requests and unicast response
   with OSCOAP is the same as in non-multicast communication, with this
   difference: the sending endpoint uses its own private key to create a
   counter signature of the COSE_Encrypt0 object (Appendix C.4 of

   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]).  The recipient uses the corresponding public
   key to verify the counter signature before proceding with the
   verification of the message.
